This is a customized fork of ckeditor5-build-classic to include the official [markdown plugin](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/markdown.html#installation) and a few others.


To build: 
```
npm install
cd packages/ckeditor5-build-classic
npm install
npm run build
```

Then simply copy `build/ckeditor.js` to where you need it.
